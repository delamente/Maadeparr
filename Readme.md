This is my web repository built from scratch, without some external help, to demonstrate what I can create from the client side (frontend). I am a person who constantly educates myself, to get ahead, I am an enthusiastic coder, not just a university student, I want to go beyond where no one could go, and achieve what few were able to achieve.
